<H1> COP3530 Project 3: Statistical Serenade </h1>
Readme file to explain how to run the project code for graders.

## How to run the code:

Build the code containing files main.cpp and NaryTree.h with the provided CMake file, and it should work as intended. See the demo video for more details.

Note to graders: if looking at contribution history, all 3 members contributed to the code. However, Andre accidentally deleted the entire repository while in the command line and had to reupload from his personal computer. Therefore, the contribution statistics provided by Github are not accurate.
